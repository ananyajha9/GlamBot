# GlamBot

GlamBot is an AI-powered fashion recommendation system. This platform leverages advanced image processing, image segmentation, and large language model (LLM) technologies to provide personalized fashion recommendations based on a user's skin color, eye color, and hair color. The recommendations are curated specifically from Myntra's vast collection, helping users find the best outfits that match their unique color profile.

## Code Overview

### `app.py`
- Defines routes for the application (`/`, `/photo_pick`, `/loading`, `/color_analysis_results`, `/shop_myntra`).
- Handles image upload and capture, redirects to the loading page, and initiates color analysis.

### `color_analysis.py`

- Contains functions for interacting with the Gemini LLM to perform color analysis.
- Extracts recommended colors and color palettes from the LLM's response.

### `search_outfits.py`

- Contains functions to search for outfits on Myntra based on the user's color profile.
- Downloads and saves outfit images for display in the application.

### `seg_hex_model.py`

- Implements facial segmentation and color extraction using the FACER library.
- Saves segmented facial parts and extracts hex codes for skin, eye, and hair colors.
